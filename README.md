# RAWR!

RAWR is a Less framework to help you get off the ground running quickly and beautifully. RAWR uses easy to understand style like "large delete button" to help make design easy. UI elements are styled with a base color palette, so themes are easily customizable. Spacing is standardized throughout the entire framework, so your site will feel pixel perfect. RAWR includes a handful of UI elements including a grid and gallery, but avoids wasteful containers and classes.
